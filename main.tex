\begin{abstract}
Epilepsy is a brain disease that profoundly affects the personal lives of its patients as well as the health care system needed to address it. Machine learning is a field of computer science experiencing a renaissance period at a time where computers can do more work in less time than ever before. While industry has moved rapidly towards  implementation of machine learning in profitable and futuristic endeavors like autonomous driving and image recognition and creation, some basic and essential societal problems remain relatively unexamined through the lens of machine learning research, an example of which is epilepsy. This work attempts to start to fill this gap and shed light on the ways machine learning can address complex and intricate problems like epilepsy. Through it, several machine learning algorithms will be surveyed, and some simple implementations and tutorials be provided through an external companion. Furthermore, a novel definition of brain communication is introduced in the form of causality, which will also be discussed more broadly. This definition is then used to construct a network of brain communication patterns in the context of which the author attempts to apply machine learning. Finally, discoveries made in this work will highlight a lack of a general understanding and framework of brain communication patterns and the magnitude and scope of future work available in the intersection of neuroscience and machine learning.

% OLD ABSTRACT \\
% Causality is a topic of philosophical and technical debate in scientific fields relating to multivariate systems. Sugihara Causality is a new model for describing causality. We investigate how this model can be applied to highly dimensional neuronal networks where epilepsy is induced. Different brain states will be classified using a neuroclustering algorithm. The time indecies of the clustered brain states will be used to discretize the original EEG signal into different epileptic seizures stages. A causality network will be created for each stage from the discretized EEG signal, and analysis on the network will be conducted to find predictive structural patterns in epileptic seizures.

\section{Problem definition}

Given multiple spiking signals from a set of interconnected neuronal regions, can the CCM model identify structural patterns in causal relationships between those regions? Can the patterns and properties of the causality graph resulting from the CCM model be clustered into brain states that represent different stages of epilepsy in the brain? In other words, can a machine learning algorithm be applied to the causal network properties, the model of which could be able to correctly classify epileptic brain states.

\section{Methods}
\subsection{Data Collection}
EEG data was collected from an 4x8 endodermal electrode array (31 channels, one channel malfunctioned, Fig. \ref{fig:rat_brain_schematic}, \ref{fig:rat_scull_and_instrument}). During the experiment epileptic seizures were evoked using 4-aminopyridine and EEG data was recorded from the electrode array. The spiking voltage of each recorded electrode is used as a signal and is referred to as a channel. 

\subsection{Data Preprocessing}
Kernel Current Source Density (kCSD) method was used on the grid of channels to account for possible electrical interference with the direct measurement \cite{Potworowski2012}. The measured potentials produced by kCSD arise as the linear combination of the transmembrane currents, which is a more direct and localized quantity to measure the neural activity. Therefore current source density distribution was calculated by the kCSD method and used for the analysis.

Afterwards, in order to reduce the data size that is operated on, we lumped channels from the same regions together by averaging them (Fig. \ref{fig:brain_region_lumping}). In addition to reducing dimensionality, this process also puts emphasis of causality on functional brain regions instead of a local cluster of neurons. 

  
% TO BE ADDED ONCE THE SPLINE DATA HAS BEEN ANALYZED
% To reduce the amount of data being processed by the algorithm, a moving average was calculated for each channel as in Fig. \ref{fig:spline_sample}. The moving average line was also added to reduce the random variability that might erroneously affect the Sugihara calculations. More importantly, the moving average calculation removes the spiking pattern dimension of the neuronal region, and keeps only the magnitude of neuronal excitation. We reckon that this assumption could be beneficial for the CCM algorithm since without it, the algorithm could infer that two noise up spikes in two channels might be causal simply because they happen in temporal proximity caused by measurement error.

\subsection{Experiments}
Using the preprocessed data, a pairwise analysis of the signals will be carried using CCM. For each pair of regions, two directions of causality will be considered. Since there were $12$ regions, $12*11=132$ unique causality relationships were analyzed. The causality measures were recorded on sliding windows of time segments. The time segment lengths were chosen through a heuristic that focused on attaining multiple causality measures within a second. Once the causality measures were attained for each time segment, a combination of heuristic and and statistical measures were used to analyze the significance of the causality measures (see section \ref{subsec:significant_causality}). 

From the causality measures, a graph was constructed for each time segment (Fig. \ref{fig:sample_graph}). 

% From the graph, the following experiments were conducted

% \subsubsection{Activity Clustering}
% Using the k-means clustering algorithm, the pairwise causality graphs were clustered towards testing if the algorithm can detect phases of different activities.

% \subsubsection{Epilepsy Localization}
% To localize the origin of epilepcy during a time segment, the regions with high outgoing causality degrees were considered. The evaluation method was a simple sum of out degrees.

\subsection{Significant Causality Measures}
\label{subsec:significant_causality}
Since every CCM computation returns a real number in the range $[0,1]$ that represents a relative causality measure, $132$ causality measures for each time segement will be returned. Therefore, an important question to consider is how exactly should a causality measure be defined to be significant. Although Sugihara \textit{\textit{et al.}} \cite{Sugihara2012} and Nes \textit{et al.} \cite{Nes2015} carry out a significance test based on altering the signals by random shuffling and Fourier transformation on Phase shift \cite{Ebisuzaki1997}, this method has not been implemented on EEG data when applying the CCM model. Therefore, we do not rely on it completely, and take into account several heuristic conditions.


\subsubsection{Most Causal Relationship Method}
In this method, a simplistic approach is taken whereby for each region only the highest incoming $\rho$ is considered. While this approach is reductionist by definition, and most likely does not reflect the true causal relationship in the brain, it achieves simplicity in the network, and affords us the possibility of examining which regions could be the most causal in the network. Such regions would have a large out degree which would imply it being a center of causality in the network.

Another important property of this measure is that it could alleviate the problem of downstream causality sensitivity. As shown by Ye \textit{\textit{et al.}} \cite{Ye2015}, the CCM algorithm can detect downstream causality, which means that if $\alpha$ causes $\beta$ and $\beta$ causes $\kappa$, then if $\rho_{\alpha \rightarrow \beta}$ is a significant causality measure from $\alpha$ to $\beta$, there can also be a causality measure $\rho_{\alpha \rightarrow \kappa}$ detected to be significant such that the indirect causality is less than the direct causality $\rho_{\alpha \rightarrow \kappa} < \rho_{\alpha \rightarrow \beta}$. This can be an undesired consequence of the model, since we are interested only in the direct relationships, and not necessarily the indirect ones. Indirect relationships could be extrapolated from direct ones. If we assume that all downstream causality measures are evaluated to be less than their direct counterparts, then we expect that taking the most causal relationship would rid of all the indirect relationships that could otherwise be detected, with the expense of also ridding of other direct relationships.

\subsubsection{Threshold Method}
In this method, only causality measure over a certain threshold $\rho_{th}$ will be counted as significant. As this is a heuristic measure, the data must first be examined to clarify what is meant by a significant $\rho_{th}$. With this heuristic comes unavoidable human bias towards refusing generated data. Since the true causality relationships are not yet uncovered, almost any threshold is certain to be wrong. For example, if the brain was highly connected and regions are highly causal to one another, a neuroscientist who disregards such a possibility would be inclined to choose a high $\rho_{th}$ as to filter many of the causal relationships that could in fact be present. Alternatively, if the brain regions were minimally causal to one another and a neuroscientist disregards that possibility, they would be inclined to choose a low $\rho_{th}$ as to allow for more causal relationships for the model. However biased this method is, if implemented correctly it could provide a list of the most causal relationships to each region, while excluding most indirect relationships.

\subsubsection{Fourier Transform and Random shuffling Method}
For a more mathematically grounded significance measure, we also use a bootstrap test where a signal for both channels in a pair is created from the original signal, and the causality measure is significant if it is above a specified $\alpha$ threshold. Another statistical method used to calculate significance is randomizing the data based on bootstraping the frequency distribution of the signal calculated from the signal's Fourier transform as used by Nes \textit{et al.} \cite{Nes2015}\cite{Takens1981}.


\section{Results}
By running the CCM algorithm through every pair of channels, we collected $132$ causality measures (Fig. \ref{fig:sample_pair_causality_plot}). To increase the efficiency of our calculations, we also observed the variance of the causality strengths as we decreased the sample size for each calculation (Fig. \ref{fig:sample_size_diff_box}). Most of the causality measures appear to be of high values, suggesting high connectivity between brain regions (Fig. \ref{fig:sample_pair_causality_plot}). Furthermore, we also notice that many of the pair causality measures appear to be similar within the pair (Fig. \ref{fig:diff_within_pair_hist}). For example, when looking at regions 1 and 2 within the first 200 ms, they appear to be equally causal to one another (Fig. \ref{fig:sample_pair_causality_plot}).

The skill mapping channel 1 to channel 2 is very similar to the one mapping channel 2 to channel 1. This might infer either bidirectional causality or unidirectional forcing. A similar pattern (close $\rho$ value between pairs) was found for most of the pairs. Cross mapping was done with random library samples.}

\section{Discussion}

Initial analysis shows that the causality network is very dense with highly weighted edges. The high density of the graph could have been a side effect of Sugihara's model ability to detect downstream causality. If that is the case, then many of the causal connections detected are in fact residuals of upstream interactions in the network.

Downstream causality measures can be detected by observing both the magnitude of the cross map skill as well as the time lag that produces the greatest cross map skill (Fig. 3 in \cite{Ye2015}). Following the assumption that downstream causality decreases in magnitude as it travels downstream in the network, we can use this to traverse the graph and rid of any paths that decreases in causality as it goes downstream.

Concerning the high possibility of the presence of unidirectional forcing, Ye \textit{et al.} showed unidirectional forcing can be untangled by inspecting the greatest time lag of the two that produces the highest causality measure (Fig. 2 in \cite{Ye2015}). In order to allay the problem of unidirectional forcing, the best lag of each pair is considered. This is a tricky problem because there is no clear range for which to test the lag. This is because the time delay for neuronal activity is yet studied, and how that translates to EEG data could be tricky. We reserve the use of this method due to its computational complexity which would add to the already high time complexity of the analysis.

The theoretical implications of this model could present a novel representation of information flow in the brain and determining causality within the brain. If the graph output of this method id reliable, it could help outline information flow within the brain, much like one would observe in a magnetic wave flowing through an fMRI recording. 



\section{Future Work}

Future work will focus on verifying this model through controlled experiments. Such experiments could be in the form of stimulating a part of the brain (e.g. shining strong light on an the eye to excite the visual cortex) and observing the model's behavior. One would expect a high value of out degrees from the specific region during such an experiment, as it attempts to convey a considerable portion of information to the rest of the brain. Moreover, a clear proof should be presented as to what the most reliable time window and step size ought to be when producing the causality graphs. Such a task can be done by measuring graph similarity of the same time segment as the time window gets shortened incrementally.

Continuing our efforts, we would like to integrate the neuroclustering algorithm developed by Lewis and Mello into this work \cite{Lewis2012}. This would allow us to discretize the EEG data into frames of epileptic seizure stages. Once these stages are identified and compartmentalized, the kCSD method will be applied to account for experimental design errors. A pairwise causality network will then be constructed using the Sugihara causality model, and the origin of the epilepsy will be localized during the initiation of the seizure.

Furthermore, the feature set of the neuroclustering algorithm could be augmented with the information of edge weights of the pairwise causation graph. The effect of such an integration could be tested to see if it improves classification metrics. Similarly, the neuroclustering algorithm could be used to label seizures in neural data which then our pairwise causality algorithm could be tested against to see if the clustering of edge weights clusters epilepsy segments separately.


\section{Conclusion}
The paper shows promising initial results using the Sugihara CCM model to construct causality graphs between brain regions. We find that the brain network for this experiment is highly causal with a range of time windows. This, however, could be due in part to experimental design limitations, where the electrodes were 1 mm apart which might have caused electrical interference. To to limit this phenomenon we used kCSD to preprocess the data. Initial results show a time varying graph in which information flow can be tracked. At the moment, more analysis is required to make a conclusions on the capabilities of the pairwise causality graph model. Some of most incurring difficulties to overcome are the running complexity of the kCSD preprocessing and CCM algorithm required for the analysis of the amount of pairs in a large network, and the mathematical representation of information flow within the time-dependent graph. We plan on using the Neuroclustering algorithm to discretize the EEG data into epileptic seizures, extract causal network features from the stages, and train a k-means learning algorithm on the created feature set. The implications of these findings could relate more generally to discoverability of causality in modeling scalable natural phenomena. Real world applications manifest in localization of epilepsy in the brain. Furthermore, if the technique of distinguishing causal networks in systems and clustering their properties is successful, it could be a clear indications that the Sugihara causality model is able to detect causation in extremely complex systems comparable to the human brain.
