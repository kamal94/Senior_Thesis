\begin{abstract}
Epilepsy is a brain disease that profoundly affects the personal lives of its patients as well as the health care system needed to address it. Machine learning is a field of computer science experiencing a renaissance period at a time where computers can do more work in less time than ever before. While industry has moved rapidly towards  implementation of machine learning in profitable and futuristic endeavors like autonomous driving and image recognition and creation, some basic and essential societal problems remain relatively unexamined through the lens of machine learning research, an example of which is epilepsy. This work attempts to start to fill this gap and shed light on the ways machine learning can address complex and intricate problems like epilepsy. Through it, several machine learning algorithms will be surveyed, and some simple implementations and tutorials be provided through an external companion. Furthermore, a novel definition of brain communication is introduced in the form of causality, which will also be discussed more broadly. This definition is then used to construct a network of brain communication patterns in the context of which the author attempts to apply machine learning. Finally, discoveries made in this work will highlight a lack of a general understanding and framework of brain communication patterns and the magnitude and scope of future work available in the intersection of neuroscience and machine learning.

\section{Conclusion}
Epilepsy is a neural disorder that profoundly affects the life of patients. The motivation behind this work is to relief epilepsy patients from some of the pain by detecting seizures using brain activity as measured by EEG recordings. My personal interest and fascination in Machine Learning led me to seek research opportunities in this field, placing me in a great opportunity at the University of Colorado Colorado Springs (UCCS). Under the supervision of Dr. Peter Erdi, Dr. Rory Lewis, and Dr. Jugal Kalita, my work at UCCS explored the intersection between my interest in machine learning and my social obligation to elevate Epilepsy. As I delved into machine learning, my fascination only grew, and the more I realized its potential to revolutionize the way modern society can operate. At the same time, the more I studied the brain, the clearer it became that the neuroscience field still has no clear framework to define communication between brain regions. For this purpose, I used the newly found Sugihara CCM model, creating a way to define causation between brain regions, and using that as a heuristic for brain communication. Using this definition, I applied a clustering algorithm to the resulting brain communication network and found that the communication networks do not provide a clear distinction between epileptic and non epileptic states. This project has propelled me to explore mathematical and biological concepts outside of my comfort zone, a compulsory part of any research position. It has given me a greater appreciation for the field of neuroscience and the difficulty that researchers in that field must face when pushing the envelope. In the end, I remain motivated to dig deeper into Machine Learning, and believe more now than ever that it will be the gate towards a better and brighter future for mankind.
