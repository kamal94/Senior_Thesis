# Classifying Epileptic Brain States Using Structural Features of Neuronal Sugihara Causation Networks

This project is the culmination of my work over the MLND program at Udacity and my summer Research Experience for Undergraduates at UCCS (Colorado). All the information required to understand this project is in the file **main.pdf**. Two companion python notebooks have been provided for the production of figures, exploration of the data, and reproducibility.

A short video that summarizes part of the procedure done in this work can be found [here](https://vimeo.com/183266314).

To run the python notebooks, you will need to install the following prerequisite programs:

### Install

This project requires **Python 3.5** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [Pickle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org)
- [PIL](http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/)
- [colour](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/colour)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) (also called Jupyter).

### Code
Reproduction of figures can be done by running the `companion.ipynb` notebook file.
Exploration code is provided in the notebook `clustering companion.ipynb` notebook file. 

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `student_intervention/` (that contains this README) and run the following commands appropriately:

```jupyter notebook Clustering\ notebook.ipynb.ipynb```
```jupyter notebook companion.ipynb.ipynb```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.

## Data
To use the python notebook, you will have to download the dataset for this project. The dataset used in this project can be [downloaded from the cloud](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzyCB-i-aKDWU2pBYkVoOV81S3M/view).
