\section{outline}
Here is my proposed outline for the SIP:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Abstract: Summarize the introduction, methods, results, and conclusion

  \item Introduction: Introduce the focus of this SIP and the purpose for which it has been conducted.

  \item Background: A gentle reminder to myself as much as the audience that the domain presented henceforth is not a common one, so a well placed background seems necessary to allow accessibility to all readers.

	\item Epilepsy: Provide a somewhat comprehensive history of the discovery, diagnosis, treatment of, and recovery from epilepsy. Stress why treating it remains so elusive and highly risky.

	\item Machine Learning: This is probably the most computer-sciency aspect of the SIP. Describe the three main branches of ML, where they are used, and the success rate of several techniques in each.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Supervised Learning
			\item Unsupervised Learning
			\item Reinforcement Learning
		\end{itemize}

	\item Causality and the Sugihara Model: Give a brief overview of the field and study of causality (Granger, Judea Pearl). Describe and explain the Sugihara model and the reasons for why it was chosen. Give examples of where it was used successfully.
  \item Methods and Experiments: 

  \item Results

  \item Discussion
  
  \item Conclusion 
\end{itemize}
