\subsection{Unsupervised Learning}
While supervised learning aims to entangle patterns by examining data that has been labeled by humans, unsupervised learning attempts to do the same with unlabeled data. This requires algorithms that can examine unstructured data and find commonalities and dissimilarities between data points. Humans are exceptional at unsupervised learning,
