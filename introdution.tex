\section{Introduction}
This SIP will be on the topic of Machine Learning (ML) its usage in the biological and medical fields. My thesis will be more specifically that the origin site of epilepsy in the brain can be approximately located using ML.



Machine Learning is the science of training a machine to recognize certain patterns in the given data. There are 3 main subcategories of ML, namely supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. While all of these categories have been used in the biological field, my own work has been done in supervised and unsupervised learning. The data of my work is comprised of voltage signals collected through electroencephalogram (EEG) electrodes inserted into specific regions of the brain. As the brain alters in state, the voltage fluctuates, and these fluctuations are recorded by this electrode. Due to the nature of epilepsy, only one electrode is typically required to identify the stages of an epileptic seizure. However, our thesis is that recording of multiple EEG electrodes in the brain could help not only identify epilepsy but also localize its origin in the brain.
